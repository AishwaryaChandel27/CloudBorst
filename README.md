# Cloud Burst Prediction Model

## Overview
This repository contains code for a cloud burst prediction model. The model utilizes machine learning algorithms to forecast the occurrence of cloud bursts based on meteorological data.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebooks)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AishwaryaChandel72/cloudburst-prediction.git

markdown
Copy code

2. Install the required Python libraries:
pip install -r requirements.txt

markdown

## Dataset
The model requires a dataset containing historical meteorological data including variables such as temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed, and precipitation. Ensure the dataset is preprocessed and formatted appropriately before running the model.

## Usage
1. Prepare your dataset and ensure it is in the correct format (e.g., CSV, Excel).
2. Run the provided Jupyter Notebook `cloud_burst_prediction.ipynb` or execute the Python script `cloud_burst_prediction.py`.
python cloud_burst_prediction.py

vbnet
Copy code
3. Follow the instructions in the notebook or script to load the dataset, train the model, and make predictions.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using appropriate metrics and visualization techniques.

## Model Evaluation
- The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Visualize the model's predictions against actual cloud burst events to assess its effectiveness.

## Contributing
Contributions to improve the model's performance, add new features, or fix bugs are welcome. Please fork the repository, make your changes, and submit a pull request.

## Acknowledgements
- Special thanks to [source of dataset] for providing the meteorological data used in this project.
